This is a simple 16-bit interface designed to take in a series of 16-bit words and verify that the CRC at the end of the data set is valid. 

The idea is that you can feed this module a standard soma-style 16-bit-wide ethernet frame and it will tell you whether or not the FCS at the end of the frame is valid. 

Inputs: 

DIN[15:0] : data input
DINEN : data input enable
CLK: The clock 
RESET: Reset system state

Outputs: 
CRCVALID: asserted synchronous with done if the byte stream / frame was valid
DONE: asserted when we have read all of our bytes 

We need to accomodate both byte and word-wide sets of data, which is a
problem. Thus we have two sets of CRC combinational logic, an 8-bit
wide one and a 16-bit wide one.
