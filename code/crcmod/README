The software in this package is a Python module for generating objects that
compute the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).  There is no attempt in this package
to explain how the CRC works.  There are a number of resources on the web that
give a good explanation of the algorithms.  Just do a Google search for "crc
calculation" and browse till you find what you need.  Another resource can be
found in chapter 20 of the book "Numerical Recipes in C" by Press et. al.

This package allows the use of any 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit CRC.  You can generate
a Python function for the selected polynomial or an instance of the Crc class
which provides the same interface as the md5 and sha modules from the Python
standard library.  A Crc class instance can also generate C/C++ source code
that can be used in another application.

----------
Guidelines
----------

If you are simply looking for something to compute a strong checksum (typically
referred to as a message digest) over some data, I strongly suggest you use the
md5 module.  As shown in the timing study below, the MD5 algorithm has about
the same performance as a 32-bit CRC generated with this module.  In addition,
MD5 is a cryptographically strong message digest.  As discussed in RFC 1321,
the probability of having the same digest for two data sets is 2^-64 which is
the same as a 64-bit CRC.  A CRC can be fooled into generating the same value
by simply adding any multiple of the generator polynomial to the original
message.  This is very difficult to do with the MD5 algorithm.

If you are still interested in this module, you have an application that
requires the use of a CRC.  Documentation is available from the doc strings.
It is up to you to decide what polynomials to use in your application.  If
someone has not specified the polynomials to use, you will need to do some
research to find one suitable for your application.  Examples are available in
the unit test script test_crcmod.py and the timing script timing_test.py.

If you need to generate code for another language, I suggest you subclass the
Crc class and replace the method generate code.  Use generateCode as a model
for the new version.

------------
Installation
------------

To install this module, copy the files crcmod.py and _crcfunpy.py to any
directory on your Python path.  Then run the unit test script test_crcmod.py.

If you intend to use this module in a Python application (as opposed to just
using the code generator), you should build the extension module that replaces
_crcfunpy.py.  The build process uses the distutils module so it should build
correctly for any platform.  To perform the build, just run the following from
the extmod directory.

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

When the build completes, copy the _crcfunext module to the directory where you
placed crcmod.py.  Note that the file extension for _crcfunext is platform
dependent.  On many Unix and all Linux systems, the extension is .so.  On
Windows, it is .pyd.

Note that crcmod automatically selects the extension module if it is available
so you don't need to do anything more.

------------
Unit Testing
------------

The script test_crcmod.py is the unit test for crcmod.  When you first install
the package, you should run this test to make sure everything is installed
properly.  This script performs a number of tests including a comparison to the
direct method which uses a class implementing polynomials over the integers
mod 2.

The unit test script also demonstrates how to use the code generator.  The
result of this is written out to the file examples.c.  The generated code was
checked to make sure it compiles with the GCC compiler.

------
Timing
------

A few timing measurements were taken using the timeit module in the Python
standard library.  The Python implementation is compared to the extension
module, the md5 module in the standard library, and the crc32 function from the
binascii module.  These measurements were taken on my development system which
is a 3GHz Pentium IV with hyper threading running the Debian Sarge distribution
of Linux with the 2.6.6 version of the kernel.  The Python version is 2.3.3.

The following result was obtained by running the timing_test.py script twice.
Once with the Python version and once with the extension module.

Timing in microseconds per iteration
min and max of 10 repetitions
  CRC:  14981.4,  15035.8   Python implementation
  CRC:     64.2,     64.4   extension module
  md5:     59.0,     59.3
crc32:     87.2,     87.4

It is interesting that on this system, the md5 module is slightly faster than a
32-bit CRC even though the message digest is 128-bits and is cryptographically
more secure.  This is surprising since the MD5 code looks a lot more complex.
I tried unrolling the inner loop and using the function interface instead of
the class interface.  These changes only got the result down to where the MD5
and CRC took about the same amount of time.

Note: the crc32 is slower because it includes a mask operation to get the low
order byte of a 32-bit word.  A cast is used in the CRC module to accomplish
the same thing.
